## 🎯 The Bottom Line

### The Question
Should FitIQ remain a single app or split into multiple apps?

### The Answer
**Split into two focused apps: FitIQ (fitness) + Lume (wellness)**

### Why?
1. ✅ Better user experience (focused, simple)
2. ✅ Clear market positioning (two categories)
3. ✅ Technical feasibility (architecture ready)
4. ✅ Manageable effort (3-4 months)
5. ✅ Positive ROI (6-9 months)
6. ✅ No backend changes needed
7. ✅ Natural domain boundary (quantitative vs qualitative)

### What Now?
1. Review [ASSESSMENT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](ASSESSMENT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)
2. Make decision (approve, research more, or choose alternative)
3. If approved: Start [SPLIT_STRATEGY_QUICKSTART.md](SPLIT_STRATEGY_QUICKSTART.md) Phase 1

### Q: Which document should I read first?
**A:** [ASSESSMENT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](ASSESSMENT_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md) - It's designed as the starting point.

### Q: Where are the architecture diagrams?
**A:** [docs/SPLIT_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md](docs/SPLIT_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md) - ASCII diagrams showing architecture, flow, and migration.

### Q: How long will implementation take?
**A:** 9-12 weeks (3-4 months) with 2-3 developers. See [SPLIT_STRATEGY_QUICKSTART.md](SPLIT_STRATEGY_QUICKSTART.md) for details.

### Q: What if we decide not to split?
