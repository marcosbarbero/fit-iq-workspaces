    AI-powered wellness insights API for FitIQ platform.

    ## Overview
    The Insights API provides automated, personalized wellness insights based on user data.
    Insights are generated using AI and delivered to users at regular intervals (daily, weekly) or on-demand.

    ## Data Source Endpoints
    - **Wellness Endpoint** (ACTIVE): Uses mood entries, journal entries, and goals only
    - **Fitness Endpoint** (FUTURE): Will include workout and activity data
    - **Nutrition Endpoint** (FUTURE): Will include meal and nutrition data
    - **Holistic Endpoint** (FUTURE): Will combine all data sources

    ## Features
    - **Daily Insights**: End-of-day summaries with actionable tips
    - **Weekly Insights**: Comprehensive weekly analysis and patterns
    - **Milestone Insights**: Celebration of achievements
    - **Pattern Insights**: Discovery of correlations and trends

    ## Authentication
    All endpoints require both:
    - **API Key** (via `X-API-Key` header)
    - **JWT Token** (via `Authorization: Bearer` header)

    ## Data Encryption
    Sensitive fields (title, content, summary, suggestions) are encrypted at rest.
    API responses contain decrypted data ready for display.

    ## Rate Limiting
    Standard rate limits apply. See main API documentation.
